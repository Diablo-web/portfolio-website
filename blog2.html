            “Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes, of which
            all men have some.”

            Never would I have imagined that I made this far. In a world full of copies, how did you managed to stay so
            original?

            I still remember Dr. A. P. J. Kalam’s ideas in his book India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium.
            Although India being a developing country in 2020, I truly appreciate the efforts WE took to pull off our
            Sir’s objectives.

            That pandemic, that blemish on the face of the globe, that living misery you’ve gone through, you left no
            stone unturned to bounce back.
            The lockdown completely transformed the world’s living culture. Digitalization, which was just a blooming
            term in your past decades has now unfurled all coordinates on Earth. Though it may sound a bit clichéd,
            WFH(Work From Home) is now an officially accepted worldwide practice. No offices, No HQs, No work-stations,
            Nothing! The only sad part is the replacement of humans by AI(Artificial Intelligence).
            <br />
            Yes, you read that correctly. It is like “The Survival of the fittest.”
            <br />
            There is an abundance of resources to catch up in this race of survival, the survival of ceaselessly scaling
            up yourself.
        </p>

            You were fortunate, yours’ was the only time human-to-human interaction existed. Perhaps it still was
            descending and eventually finished.
            Emotions hardly matter to us now. An effect of terminating human interaction. I feel very dejected to say
            that WE didn’t even spare nature. Industrialization totally banished nature’s minuscule existence.

            As they say “Good always comes with some bad.” So there are a few of many things that really happened in
            this decade of which the great used to always think of. The world has now collectively agreed to the plan of
            0(Zero) Gas vehicles and 100% Electric vehicles. 2030, effectively has no new additions of generating
            capacity from fossil-fuel-based technologies. Objectives for a Clean/Green/Healthy environment are now been
            laid out to the world and surprisingly everybody understands the gravity of the situation. Transportation
            delay today is just an issue of the old days.
            Hyperloop tech has now brought in a completely new revolution. As I said, these are just a few of many
            things happening in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Encompassing mentions seem balanced so far, right? Even I thought, yes, it is, obviously. Yet, there are
            some minute but colossal things WE are missing.
            I will let my present me refer, the past me, to improvise the future US.
